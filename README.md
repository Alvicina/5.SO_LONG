In order to do this we get to use the MLX graphics library:

You basically first need to parse the map and check that it meets the subject requirements for a valid map. Also, make sure that is it a playable map, eg: the player can reach all of the coins/objects/consumables etc. In my case, i did this with a simple version of the floodfill algorythm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuiXOc81UDM&t=210s. 
The link provided above it is just one of the many tutorials that explain how the algorythm works. Once you`ve checked the map is a valid and playable map, it is time to use the MLX graphics functions.

This project was first done and finished in a different repo to this one (42 camps provides us with independent repos for each project). Once finished, the project was then copied to my personal repo in gitHub.

In the following pdf you can find the project requirements as specified by 42 campus: [README_SO_LONG.pdf](https://github.com/Alvicina/SO_LONG/files/15310083/README_SO_LONG.pdf)

The following snapshot if proof that the project was succesfully done:
